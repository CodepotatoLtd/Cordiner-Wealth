As even the birds on the trees now know, every last Friday of the month Metis Ireland hosts the #MetisMorningRiverRun.

It's a 5K run that starts at 7am on the button from St. Michaels Rowing Club and out along the riverbank for a lovely morning jaunt with no pressure on anybody.

After our run in September, Graham Burns, one of our regular supporters,  came to us and said that his crew in CPL had a fantastic idea to host a run to support Limerick Suicide Watch (LSW) but rather than look at a whole new event could they “piggyback” on the established  #MetisMorningRiverRun

LSW is a suicide prevention group, founded in 2016, they patrol the river Shannon at night. Since establishing themselves they have had over 200 interventions in helping people who may be in distress or contemplating suicide.
LSW aim to onboard 10 new volunteers by the end of 2020.  The organisation is not government funded, it costs approximately €450 to fully equip new volunteers and they are completely dependent on donations.

We agreed with Graham that it was a fantastic initiative, and when word spread HOMS Solicitors also came on board to help the event make an even bigger impact.

With LSW's target in mind, the combined forces of CPL, HOMS and Metis Ireland got together and planned the run for Friday November 1st to try raise €5000 to cover the full onboarding cost. As regular participants know the run does not ask of anything from people but we felt this was a worthy cause.

We set out to create “One Wonderful Experience” for everyone. We designed the poster, split the duties and created a profile on the IDonate page to cater for donations.

As with everything the day finally arrived. We were in St. Michaels Rowing Club from 6:15 waiting in anticipation, and the turnout… what can we say other than unbelievable. Close to 100 people came along with just one purpose in mind… to help!
Some ran, some walked, some joined afterwards but all wanted to do their bit to help LSW in their incredible voluntary selfless work.
